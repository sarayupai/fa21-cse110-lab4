1.  3 is printed to the console. This is because i is printed and i equals 3 after running the loop.
2.  150 is printed to the console. This is because discountedPrice is equal to the last calculated discounted price.
3.  150 is printed to the console. This is because finalPrice is the rounded value of the last calculated discounted price.
4.   This function returns an array of values containing the discounted prices. It achieves this by going throigh the original price array and applying the discount to each value, adding the new value to a discount array.
5.   The code cause an error "i is not defined" because it attempts to access i outside its scope (the for-loop)
6.   The code cause an error "discountedPrice is not defined" because it attempts to access discountedPrice outside its scope (the for-loop)
7.   150 is printed to the console bceause finalPrice is defined for the whole function block and equals the last calculted rounded discounted price.
8.   This function returns an array of values containing the discounted prices. It achieves this by going throigh the original price array and applying the discount to each value, adding the new value to an discount array. 
9.   The code causes an error "i is not defined" because the code attempts to access i outside its scope (the for-loop). 
10.  3 is printed to the console. This is because length is equal to the length of the prices array.
11.   This function returns an array of values containing the discounted prices. It achieves this by going throigh the original price array and applying the discount to each value, adding the new value to an discount array.

       1.  
           1.  '32'
           2.  integer was mapped to exact string representation then strings were concatenated  
       2.  
           1.  1 
           2.  string was mapped to exact integer represenation then arithmetic was performed 
       3.  
           1.  3 
           2.  null is mapped to 0 then arithmetic was performed 
       4. 
          1.   '3null' 
          2.   null was converted to a string then strings were concatenated
       5.  
           1.  4
           2.  true was mapped to 1 then arithmetic was performed
       6.  
           1.  0 
           2.  false and null were mapped to 0 then arithmetic was performed 
       7.  
           1.  '3undefined' 
           2.  undefined was converted to a string then the strings were concatenated
       8.  
           1.  NaN 
           2.  undefined is not mapped to a number, so the aritmetic cannot be performed giving Not-A-Number
14.    
       1.     
              1.     true 
              2.     string was mapped to exact integer represention then comparison was performed
       1.     
              1.     false 
              2.     string comparisons compare using alphabet and alphabetically '2' is greater than '1'
       2.    
             1.     true
             2.     string is converted to exact integer representation then comparison is performed
       3.     
              1.     false
              2.     2 and '2' are not the same type 
       4. 
          1.  false 
          2.  true is mapped to 1 which is not equal to 2 
       5. 
          1. true 
          2. Boolean(2) evaluates to true because 2 has a value
15.    == checks value equality and === checks value and type equality

17.    
       1.     [2, 4, 6] 
       2.     First, the execution enters function modifyArray and creates a new array. For each element in original array, the value of the element is passed to the function doSomething and the value that returns (twice the intitial value) is added to the new array, which is returned.
